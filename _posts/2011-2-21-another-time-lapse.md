<p>Another time-lapse, this time of a different type of lotus flower.

<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vh_pn6fATKw?rel=0"></iframe>

<p>The flower didn’t open fully — possibly because it was quite windy — so I decided half way to experiment with zooming in on the flower. The result is quite jerky and a bit distracting. Evidently manual adjustment of the camera lens is just too clumsy for this sort of thing.
<p>It’s curious how the lotus closes really quickly towards the end.
