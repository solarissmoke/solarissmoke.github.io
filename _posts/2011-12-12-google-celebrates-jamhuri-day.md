title: Google celebrates Jamhuri day
---
<p><a href="http://google.co.ke">Google</a> is celebrating Jamhuri day in Kenya with a nice doodle today. I particularly like the detail on the lettering.
<p class="center"><img alt="Google Doodle for Kenya, 12 December 2011" src="http://www.google.com/logos/2011/kenyaind11-hp.jpg" />
<p>Jamhuri day is the anniversary of Kenya’s independence from the United Kingdom (1963), and also of its formally becoming a republic (1964).
<p>“Harambee” loosely translates to “let’s all pull together”.
