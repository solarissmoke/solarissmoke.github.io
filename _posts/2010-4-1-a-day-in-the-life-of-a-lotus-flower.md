<p>A speeded-up view of a day in the life of a lotus flower in our garden.

<p>The pictures are taken using a digital SLR camera. It took several attempts to get this right — prior failed attempts included: forgetting to set the right metering mode; running out of battery power; failing to take into account the fact that the sun moves during the day, and if the camera isn’t well positioned there will be a strange shadow creeping over the frame; birds having a splash in the water and getting drops on the lens.
